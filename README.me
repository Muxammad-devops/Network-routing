Cisco Packet Tracer – Multi-Routing Lab (EIGRP, OSPF, RIP v2, Static)

This lab demonstrates a multi-domain network built in Cisco Packet Tracer, combining different routing protocols in separate segments: EIGRP, OSPF, RIP v2, and static routing.
The goal was to practice protocol configuration, IP addressing, VLAN segmentation, and end-to-end connectivity across heterogeneous routing domains.

What’s implemented

Multiple routing domains:

EIGRP segment

OSPF segment

RIP v2 segment

Static routing segment

VLANs on access switches (VLAN 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

Router-to-router point-to-point links (/32 addressing on interconnects)

Interconnection between routing domains

End-to-end reachability (PC-to-PC across different protocols)

How to use

Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x recommended).
After the topology loads, you can verify connectivity with:

ping between hosts in different segments

show ip route on routers to inspect EIGRP / OSPF / RIP / static routes

show ip protocols to confirm routing processes

Notes

This lab was created for learning and practice purposes.
Each routing domain is isolated and then interconnected to simulate real-world mixed-protocol networks.
The addressing and design are kept simple to focus on routing behavior and protocol interaction.
